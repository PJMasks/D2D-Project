### Air Quality Dataset(Source: UCI)


#### Why is it Interesting?!
Local air quality affects how you live and breathe. Like the weather, it can change from day to day or even hour to hour. 
Air pollution is one of the most serious problems in the world. It refers to the contamination of the atmosphere by harmful chemicals or biological materials. To solve the problem of air pollution, it's necessary to understande levels of harmful gases, and the issues that it causes and look for ways to counter it. We can do predictive modelling and develop an air quality model based on the given data. *The reason this dataset caught my eye is, as I am a Pro-Environmentalist, I was apalled at the increasing levels of the harmful gases in the air that we breathe. Also, since Im new to Data Analysis, I found a few starter scripts in R and Python, which will make the regression analysis and predictive modelling easier.*


#### Dataset Information
The dataset contains 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian city. Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year)representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for CO, Non Metanic Hydrocarbons, Benzene, Total Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and were provided by a co-located reference certified analyzer.

It has 9358 rows and 15 columns and is available in both .csv and .xlsx formats.

#### Potential data users and decision-makers for this data

Potential data users can be someone who wants to come up with air quality model or regression analysis or predictive modelling. This data is mainly used for research purposes as cited in the source: ENEA - National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development


#### Research Questions
* What is the cause for this increase in levels of the gases?
* What pattern of changes can be seen in Air Quality Index(AQI) from the data?
* Can we establish a pattern between people's health and the levels of the gases at a given period of time?
* What prediction modelling technique can be used to develop an air quality model based on the data?
