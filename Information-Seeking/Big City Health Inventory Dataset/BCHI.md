#### What makes it interesting?
The importance of having state, county, and local health-related data has been recognized in a number of studies. The availability of local level data, both general and related to specific issues, continues to improve in this technological age. Among these are several reports and data sources that have been produced to describe the relationship between levels of urbanization and health.

The purpose of this dataset is to focus specifically on the health of people living in large cities in the United States. In so doing, the report attempts to increase knowledge of the issues large cities face and stimulate dialogue that will lead to a healthier city population. In addition to improving our understanding of the health in large cities, the data in this report will serve as a reference point to monitor cities’ progress in reaching the nation’s Year 2020 objectives

#### Dataset Information
It has 13513 rows and 11 columns.
Size of the data - 6.20MB
It is available in .csv format on the source website
This dataset illustrates health status of 26 of the nation’s largest and most urban cities as captured by 34 health (and six demographics-related) indicators. These indicators represent some of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States and leading priorities of national, state, and local health agencies. Public health data were captured in nine overarching categories: HIV/AIDS, cancer, nutrition/physical activity/obesity, food safety, infectious disease, maternal and child health, tobacco, injury/violence, and behavioral health/substance abuse.
