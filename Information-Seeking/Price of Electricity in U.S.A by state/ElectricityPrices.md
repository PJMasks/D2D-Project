#### Prices of Electricity in the U.S.A(By State)

#### What makes it interesting?!
This data set shows the price of electricity across different states in US. These data set seems interesting as it can be used for regression to predict the upcoming prices. It helps us to understand the variation in the prices depending on the geography, climatic conditions, cost of living etc. In modern electricity market the electricity prices are very volatile and can be affected by several factors. It is very important to understand those factors as much as possible in order to minimize the financial risk and negative impact from buying the electricity on the market. **Personal Interest:** Though this is a relatively small dataset, I liked the usability through regression analysis. It is a great dataset to work on, for beginners.

#### Dataset Information
This data set shows the average retail price of electricity for different sectors like Residential, Commercial, Industrial and Transportation across different states in US. The pricing is in cents per kilowatt hour. This data set contains 68 rows and 12 columns. The average price people pay for electricity is about 8.08 in 2005 which is up from 7.64 in 2004. There’s a huge variation from state to state. People in Hawaii pay the most for electricity, about 18.11 while people in Idaho pay the least which is about 5.1. The region with high price is New England, about 11.79 which includes states like Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Vermont.
It is available in .csv format on the source website. It does require an API key after a free registration on the Energy Information Administration(EIA) site, which is easy to procure.

#### Usage Policy

This data set is a public domain data and can be used for statistical purposes under the usage terms by Energy Information Administration(EIA) board.

#### Potential data users and decision makers
This data is recorded by US Energy Information Administration board to change the prices across the states depending on the usage. This data set can be used for regression to predict the prices in the coming years. It also can be used in the analysis of the variation in prices across different regions and different sectors and it can help the government come with efficient policies to regulate the prices in a fair manner.

#### Research questions
* This data can be used to estimate the usage scenarios for different sectors across the states and could help in adjusting the prices. 

* This could also be used to predict the prices for the coming years using clustering techniques. 

* This data could help the policy makers, in making effective policies and regulate the prices.
